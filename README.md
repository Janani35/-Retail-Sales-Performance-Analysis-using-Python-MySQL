# **Retail Sales Performance Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover key business insights using **Python & MySQL*. It identifies top-selling products, sales trends, and peak sales months to support data-driven decision-making.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **MySQL** – Data storage and analysis


## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection** – Sourced retail sales dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Processed data using pandas (handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues).
3. **Database Management** – Loaded cleaned data into MySQL for structured analysis.
4. **Analysis & Insights**:
   - Identified top revenue-generating and best-selling products.
   - Analyzed **month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs. 2023)**.
   - Determined peak sales months for different product categories.

## **Key Outcomes**
- Identified sales trends and top-performing products.
- Provided insights for optimizing retail strategies.
- Demonstrated expertise in **Python and  MySQL **.
